## Overview

This project presents a complete functional verification environment for an SDRAM controller using **SystemVerilog** and **ModelSim**.  
The project was developed as part of the **HDL Model Verification** course at the University of Tehran under the supervision of **Dr. Siamak Mohammadi**.

The verification environment was incrementally developed through multiple project phases, including:

- Deterministic stimulus generation
- Random/semi-random stimulus generation
- Golden model implementation
- Checker and scoreboard design
- Assertion-based verification
- Functional coverage collection
- Code coverage analysis

The final implementation achieved:

- ✅ **100% Functional Coverage**
- ✅ **97.24% Code Coverage**

---

## Verification Architecture

The verification environment includes the following components:

- **Stimulus Generator**
  - Deterministic scenarios
  - Randomized scenarios

- **Golden Model**
  - Reference SDRAM behavior modeling

- **Checker**
  - Output timing and data validation

- **Scoreboard**
  - DUV vs Golden Model comparison

- **Assertions**
  - Protocol and behavior checking

- **Functional Coverage**
  - Coverage-driven verification

---

## Verification Scenarios

Implemented test scenarios include:

- Memory write/read operations
- Accessing different memory banks and rows
- Consecutive read/write transactions
- Reset behavior validation
- Invalid `X` value testing for write signal
- Corner-case verification
- Randomized transaction generation
